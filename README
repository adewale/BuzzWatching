A webapp designed to aggregate all the activity (aka buzz) around a given event.

This is my demo hack for London HackCamp@Google in June 2010.
There are many many corners cut and horrible pieces of hard-coding. That's what happens when you code at 4am.

This will get cleaned up over time. It'll happen faster if you help.

Patches welcome!!!
